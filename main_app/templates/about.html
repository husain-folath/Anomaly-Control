      <h2>Secure</h2>
      <p>
        The Foundationâ€™s first priority is to <strong>secure</strong> anomalous
        entities, objects, and phenomena before they can threaten the public.
        This involves identifying potential anomalies, isolating them from
        civilian exposure, and ensuring they are recovered with minimal disruption.

    <div class="scp-card">
      <h2>Contain</h2>
      <p>
        Once secured, anomalies must be <strong>contained</strong> to prevent
        further harm. Containment procedures range from simple locked storage
        to custom-built chambers, ensuring anomalies remain under constant surveillance.

      <h2>Protect</h2>
      <p>
        The ultimate mission of the Foundation is to <strong>protect</strong>
        humanity. By securing and containing anomalies, the Foundation shields
        the public from panic and ensures anomalies are not exploited by hostile forces.
